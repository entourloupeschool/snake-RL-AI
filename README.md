# snake-RL-AI

a first grid search on :
learning_rates = [0.001, 0.0005]
gammas = [0.8, 0.9, 0.99]
ratios = [75, 100, 125]
end_n_games = 180 # you can change this as per your requirements

gave me that lr: 0.0005, gamma: 0.9, ratio: 75 are best hyper-parameters

second grid search :
learning_rates = [0.0005, 0.0007]
gammas = [0.87, 0.89, 0.91]
ratios = [79]

best hyper-parameters :
lr: 0.0007, gam: 0.91, rt: 79
